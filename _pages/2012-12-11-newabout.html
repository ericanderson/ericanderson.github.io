<p>Hi. I'm Eric Anderson and this is my blog about all things Software Engineering (and some stuff about other things). I'm currently in my 5th year as a Software Engineer/Lead at <a href="http://palantir.com">Palantir Technologies</a> and prior to that I spent 2 years as a Lead with Octopi, Inc (a game company startup, now a part of SOE). Even further back, I held various other small engineering jobs and contracting jobs.</p>

<p>I love working at start ups and start up cultured companies. I've been blessed with the opportunity to hold so many different roles/hats: Engineer, Product Manager, Project Manager, UX Designer, Lead, Fraud Analyst, Legal Analyst, Security Analyst, Internal Tools, DevOps, etc. My 8+ professional years and 18+ programming years of experience have taught me a great deal about building successful projects, products, and businesses, and have given me a hunger to always be learning.</p>

<p>I first fell in love with coding when I was around 12 when I discovered that my computer had this cool thing called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic">QBasic</a> on it. Throughout middle school and high school, I also went on to teach myself <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuakeC">QuakeC</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_API">WinAPI</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Php">PHP</a>, MySQL, and HTML/CSS/JavaScript.</p>

<p>In High School, I was fortunate enough to find the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litestep">Litestep</a> community (a group of people building free and/or open source software to make Win95 look 'cool') and was able to build two free projects: a program launcher named <a href="http://customize.org/cn2">Codename2</a> and a skinnable notepad called <a href="http://customize.org/mypad">MyPad</a>. It was here that I became addicted to the realization that with no money, I could build something that other people valued and that they would thank me for my efforts in making their life better.</p>

<p>My college years taught me a lot about having fun, but I also learned a bit more about Java, C, and Assembly. More importantly, I learned how to think about problems deeper than simply looking at the surface. It was here that I started reading books about Product and Project Management, and obsessing over the perfect experience.</p>

<p>Thinking about experience turned out to be highly valuable at Octopi, where each dev did a good portion of their own game design. In our early days, we made J2ME cell phone games, but later graduated to making 'large scale' web games. As we moved in this direction, on top of spending a lot of time doing web development and database management, I also fell in love with backend programming. I would have never guessed that making all those little threads play nicely together would have interested me so much. It was also a time when so many people still had dialup and crappy computers that making the game work nicely was a bit more challenging than it would be today.</p>

<p>It was at Octopi that I had my first real 'lead' position. I'd been 'Head Busser' at a local Bar and Grill in high school and a 'staff' member at a university copy center, in charge of overseeing student workers, but these were very different roles than working with developers. Looking back, given the lack of mentorship, I did an okay job, but in reality, it was nothing like a real engineering lead position as I've come to know it. I did however have the 'pleasure' of learning about laying people off, which is something I will probably never forget.</p>

<p>Palantir has been a complete educational experience. I got to work alongside others who were passionate about Software Engineering. I got to build tools to improve the lives of those I was working closely with. I got to really learn about leadership, project management, release management, and product management. To this day I am still fulfilled with the opportunities of growth that lie ahead of me here and as I change roles and experience the leadership styles of others, I get to re-learn, and re-examine my own styles to become even better.</p>

<p>I believe now more than ever that there is a world of learning ahead of all of us and I hope you stick around to read my blog as I share some of the lessons, insights, and thoughts I acquire along the way.</p>
