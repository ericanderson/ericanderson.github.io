This is a SIMBL plugin for Terminal.app on Leopard that lets you name your tabs. Because this is an Alpha, I am not going to write up instructions on where to get SIMBL, how to install it, or how to install the bundle. If you don&rsquo;t already know how, then Alpha software is not for you.

That said, after installing the plugin, press Command+Shift+T to name a tab (or use the Name Tab option under the View menu).

NOTE: This has only been tested on Intel Macs with the latest version of SIMBL. If you have a PowerPC and it works for you, I&rsquo;d love to hear about it in the comments.

Also, due to the nature of me giving this away for free, I cannot guarantee it won&rsquo;t harm your computer, nor can I promise it will fix your marriage. This is for use AT YOUR OWN RISK. I wash my hands completely of responsibility.

Enjoy!
