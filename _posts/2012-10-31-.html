For family related reasons, I recently moved to DC from Palo Alto. One of the biggest changes in my relocation (I was able to stay with Palantir) was absolving my lead responsibilities and becoming an individual contributor again (with plans for starting a new team one day).



This was awesome. I was spending 90% of my day coding again which is, as many engineers know, wildly rewarding.



Even though I still don't have a team, it hasn't taken more than a few months to become "a lead" again. As it should be at any organization, being a leader is not about a title, or having direct reports, it's about the value you add as being sought out.
