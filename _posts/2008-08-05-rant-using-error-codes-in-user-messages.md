In short: DON&rsquo;T!

What in the world was Apple thinking when you try to upgrade/register/sync your iPhone/iPod and you get &ldquo;Error: -19&Prime; or &ldquo;Error: -20&Prime;?? What good does this do any one? How am I supposed to fix the problem if I don&rsquo;t know what the problem is? Isn&rsquo;t Apple the king of user-friendliness?

When you write software, you should use good error messages. You should use good exceptions. You should use descriptive values.

Granted, some things the user cannot fix. Telling the user the database connection was lost on a web application does very little good for the user. You can however tell the user that an error that was not their fault occurred. At least then I know I can come back and try again later.

Luckily, after rebooting my iPhone I was able to install the recent software update. This may not have been the problem, but certainly Apple could have notified me that I should attempt rebooting.

<strong>In any case, be nice to your damn users!</strong>
