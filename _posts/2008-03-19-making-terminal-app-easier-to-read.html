I really like the “Pro” color scheme for Terminal.app but I hate how hard it is to read the bold colors. By complete accident however, I came across this Options Page in Terminal.app:

Apparently, you can just click that “Use bright colors for bold text” checkbox and all of a sudden typing things like ls is no longer painful.  Just thought I’d share the tip.
