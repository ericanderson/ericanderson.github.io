<p>As the parent of two small children, my heart goes out to those who have suffered a loss in the Newtown, CT and to anyone who suffered a loss yesterday.</p>

<p>It's hard to see through the visceral emotional reaction that we all feel when 20 small children are slain, especially as parents, but its important to keep everything in perspective when demanding policy changes in our schools and country.</p>

<p>Did you know, there were 1,314 child fatalities in 2009 that were automobile related and that 181 of those were caused by alcohol?</p>
