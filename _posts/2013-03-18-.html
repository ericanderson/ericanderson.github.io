  <p>Holy shit. Did I accomplish anything today?</p>

<p>Finally, you've realized you're no longer a dev, you're a lead. Pour yourself a drink, it's about to get interesting.</p>

<p>At Palantir, we have a lead training course, but nothing can prepare you for that moment when you finally realize you aren't a dev any more. It sounds scary and awful and it takes awhile to get used to, but its actually a liberating moment.</p>

<p>If you're like me or any of the other leads I've spoken to, the story goes a bit like this.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don't know why my boss has no time to write code. I have a few reports, I'm responsible for a couple projects, but its not that bad. I still code 60-80% of the time. I'll just work a bit longer and all will be well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then you start getting involved in hiring. Someone on your team is has a <a href="http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2002/06/17/the_big_qa_freak_out.html">freak out moment</a>. You gain a few more people and a few more projects. You visit your customer more regularly. You actually follow through on your weekly 1:1s. Next thing you know...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fuck. I promised that code for the next release and I'm not even close. I've even barely opened my editor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Take a breath. Don't freak out. If your lead is worth anything at all, he's seen this moment coming and won't be surprised, nor disappointed.</p>

<p>You didn't get into this position by being irresponsible, tell someone that you're screwed, figure something out and lets move on.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hmm. But now I'm worthless. I just talk to people all day, do email, and read code.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yup, except your not worthless. You now have a huge new challenge in front of you, one more challenging than coding: hacking people. You see, you were put into this position because you have something you can pass on to others.</p>
