<p>This has been driving me nuts for a long time and I finally figured out the applescript for this so I figured I should share.</p>
<p>The script is:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/760535.js?file=gistfile1.scpt"></script>
<p>This script assumes you have an exchange account and a folder in that exchange account you want to use.</p>
<p>If you want to use an archive folder that is a subfolder of another folder, you&rsquo;ll want to tweak the script to say something like &ldquo;to folder archiveFolderName in folder parentFolderName in Exchange account exchangeAccount&rdquo; and add a parentFolderName variable to the top of the script.</p>
<p>Now all you have to do is save the script in: "<code>~/Documents/Microsoft User Data/Entourage Script Menu Items/Archive\cA</code>"</p>
<p>This will put it in your script menu and set the keystroke ctrl+a to &ldquo;Archive&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
